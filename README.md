# Part-of-speech (POS) tagging

The aim of this project is to perform POS tagging as sequence labelling using Recurrent Neural Architectures (RNN)  
The focus is on the **f1-score** of four different models

## RNN models
- Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)
- Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU)
- Two Bi-LSTM in sequence
- Bi-LSTM and a Dense layer

The last layer of all models is a dense layer used as classifier
